=== Purpose of Program

`RIFLEX` was developed as a tool for analysis of flexible marine riser
systems, but is as well suited for any type of slender structure, such
as mooring lines, umbilicals, and also for steel pipelines and
conventional risers.

These slender structures may be characterized by:

* Small bending stiffness
* Large deflection
* Large upper end motion excitation
* Nonlinear cross section properties
* Complex cross section structure

Due to the complex cross sections typical found for flexible pipes, a
global cross section model is applied in `RIFLEX`. This means that cross
section properties such as axial-, bending-, and torsional stiffness
must be specified as input. Furthermore, structural response is always
computed as global deformations and stress resultants (axial force,
moments). Hence, local strains and stresses in different cross section
layers and materials are not considered.

Nonlinear cross section behaviour is modelled by introducing nonlinear
relations between global deformation parameters and stress resultant,
i.e. curvature and moment; relative elongation and tension.

The program computes static and dynamic characteristics of the
structure.

Static analysis comprises:

* Equilibrium configuration
* Parameter variations of tension or position parameters, current
velocity and direction

Dynamic analysis comprises:

* Eigenvalue analysis, natural frequencies and mode shapes
* Response to harmonic motion and wave excitation
* Response to irregular wave- and motion excitation

The program is based on a nonlinear finite element formulation. The
following key features are included:

* Flexible modelling of simple as well as complex systems
* Nonlinear time domain simulation of riser motions and forces
* Nonlinear cross section properties
* Generalized Morison type of load model Simplified analysis options:
** Static analyses, catenary approximations Linearized time domain
simulation
** Frequency domain analysis

=== Program Documentation

The program documentation comprises:

* Theory Manual containing a description of mathematical models used in
the program
* User’s Manual containing description of input and output
* Release Notes for each release of the program

[[introduction_structure]]
=== Structure of Computer Program

The program system consists of four programs or modules communicating
via the file system as shown in the figure below.

.Structure of program system

A complete dynamic analysis must include a run of all modules. However,
an efficient data base system simplifies the work during a complete
study by storing input data and intermediate results. (I.e. problem
description, static configurations, wave induced vessel motions and
water particle velocities and accelerations).

Each module will be further detailed in the following.

[[introduction_structure_inpmod]]
==== INPMOD module

The `INPMOD` module reads most input data and organizes a data base for
use during subsequent analyses. Once the `INPMOD` module has been run,
several analyses can be performed by the other modules without rerun of
`INPMOD`.

[[introduction_structure_stamod]]
==== STAMOD module

The `STAMOD` module performs several types of static analyses. The
results may be used directly in parameter studies etc., and are also
used to define the initial configuration for a succeeding dynamic
analysis. Element mesh, stressfree configuration and key data for finite
element analysis are also generated by `STAMOD` based on system data
given as input to `INPMOD`.

[[introduction_structure_dynmod]]
==== DYNMOD module

The `DYNMOD` module carries out time domain dynamic analyses based on
the final static configuration, environment data and data to define
motions applied as forced displacements in the analysis. It is possible
to perform several dynamic analyses without rerun of `INPMOD` and
`STAMOD`. Response time series are stored on file for further
postprocessing by `OUTMOD`. In addition to dynamic response, natural
frequencies and modeshapes can be calculated.

[[introduction_structure_outmod]]
==== OUTMOD module

`OUTMOD` performs postprocessing of selected results generated by
`STAMOD` and `DYNMOD`. It is also possible to export time series via a
standardized file format for further postprocessing by general purpose
statistical analysis program (`STARTIMES`).

[[introduction_explanation]]
=== Explanation of Files Used

In running the 5 different `RIFLEX` modules different kinds of files are
needed. The files can be divided into the following categories:

[arabic]
. Symbolic input/output files (i.e. readable ASCII files)
. Binary files for internal communication between `RIFLEX` modules
. Files for export of results for postprocessing

An overview of files used is given in the figure
link:@ref%20File_system_for_communication_between_modules[File system
for communication between modules]. A `RIFLEX` user will only need to
specify input files for the `INPMOD`, `STAMOD`, `DYNMOD` and `OUTMOD`
modules.

The internal file communication is organized via run command procedures
and therefore hidden for the user. The file names and extensions may be
adapted to the computers operating system and the actual run command
procedures used. Description of the file name conventions used in the
standard run command procedure supplied with a `RIFLEX` installation is
given in link:@ref%20how_to_run_standard[How to use Standard Run Command
Procedures].

Below is a brief description of the files used.

[[introduction_explanation_symbolic]]
==== Symbolic input/output files

Each analysis module needs a symbolic data file to read input data from
(extension `.inp`) and one symbolic file to print out major results
(extension `.res`). These files are denoted:

* `xxxxxx.inp`: symbolic input file to module `xxxxxx`
* `xxxxxx.res`: symbolic result file from module `xxxxxx`

`xxxxxx` here means either `INPMOD`, `STAMOD`, `DYNMOD` or `OUTMOD`, see
the figure
link:@ref%20File_system_for_communication_between_modules[File system
for communication between modules]. Description of data needed in the
input files are described in Chapters 5-9 of the User Manual.

[[introduction_explanation_files_internal]]
==== Files for internal communication between modules

Files for internal communication are binary, direct access data files in
either `SAM-DMS` format (extension `.sam`) or in `FFILE` format
(extension `.ffi`). See `RIFLEX` maintenance manual for further file
format description.

A short description of the files used:

* `ifninp.sam`: storage of all data given as input to the `INPMOD`
module. System data read by `STAMOD` for generation of finite element
model, wave and transfer function data read by `DYNMOD`
* `ifnsys.sam`: contains system finite element model generated by
`STAMOD`
* `ifndmp.sam`: temporary storage of all system data. To be used in
possible restart analysis in `STAMOD`
* `ifnsta.ffi`: storage of results from static analysis
* `ifndyn.ffi`: storage of results from dynamic analysis
* `ifnirr.ffi`: storage of wave kinematics data for irregular dynamic
analysis
* `ifnplo.ffi`: storage of plot data generated by `OUTMOD`

[[introduction_explanation_files_external]]
==== Files for communication with external programs

The following files can optionally be applied to export results from
`RIFLEX` for postprocessing by other programs:

* `startimes.ts`: Export of response time series from `OUTMOD` for
postprocessing by the general purpose statistical analysis program
`STARTIMES`. File format is standard `STARTIMES` format (binary, direct
access file)
* `ifrdyn.raf`: File for communication with general purpose program for
advanced graphical presentation

[[introduction_applied]]
=== Applied Units and Physical Constants

Throughout the theory description a _consistent_ set of units is used.

In the program input the user is allowed to select mass as well as force
units. This implies that the user also has to specify the gravitational
constant as the ratio of force to mass units
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[F/M\]}$]. In order to allow inconsistent units,
e.g. latexmath:[$\mathrm{kN}$], latexmath:[$\mathrm{kg}$],
latexmath:[$\mathrm{m}$], latexmath:[$\mathrm{s}$], the acceleration in
terms of latexmath:[$\mathrm{F/M}$] ratio will be different from
acceleration in terms of the ratio length to squared time
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L/T^2\]}$]. A constant `GCONS` is therefore
introduced as a specification of the difference `GCONS`
latexmath:[$\mathrm{=\frac{F/M}{L/T^2}}$]. In the example case,
`GCONS = 0.001`.
