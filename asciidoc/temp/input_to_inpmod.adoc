== Input to INPMOD

[[inpmod_general_information]]
=== General Information

The purpose of the `INPMOD` module is to administer
reading/interpretation of system and environmental data. The following
data groups are included:

* General Control Data - Data Group A
* Single Riser Data - Data Group B
* Component Data - Data Group C
* Environmental Data - Data Group D
* Support Vessel Data - Data Group E

An `INPMOD` run may consist of a combination of the data groups, but a
data group included must be complete. Data group A is mandatory, while
data groups B-E normally will be given. All data groups except data
group A can be given more than once. Note that running `INPMOD` always
overwrites old information in the `INPFIL`. That means that all needed
data on `INPFIL` must be generated in one `INPMOD` run.

Within each group, the first two data groups (identification and control
data) must be given first, while the order of the remaning data groups,
to some extent, is arbitrary. Data groups in one section cannot be mixed
with data groups in another section. This means that when the program
finds a data group identifier it will only check the data within the
current section. If one or more errors are found, an error message is
written and an error flag is written to the `INPFIL` file. A run with
`STAMOD` or `DYNMOD` using this file will then be terminated. `INPMOD`
will continue to read data until the `END` input line is found (see
link:@ref%20inpmod_data_group_a_termination_of_input_data[Termination of
input data]) regardless of the number of errors detected.

[[inpmod_data_group_a_general_control_data]]
=== Data Group A: General Control Data

General inputs include the unit system.

[[inpmod_data_group_a_inpmod_identification]]
==== INPMOD identification text

An identification text describing the `INPMOD` run may be given. If
given, this text is printed on the front page of the `INPMOD` print
file.

[[inpmod_data_group_a_data_group_identifier]]
===== Data group identifier, one input line

Mandatory. ~~~ INPMod IDENtification TEXT CHVERS ~~~ -
`CHVERS: character(8)`: `RIFLEX` input file version, e.g. 3.2

[[inpmod_data_group_a_identification_text]]
===== Identification text, three input lines

Mandatory. ~~~ Heading, line no 1 Heading, line no 2 Heading, line no 3
~~~

Always three input lines, which may all be blank. Each line may contain
up to 60 characters.

[[inpmod_data_group_a_selection_of_unit_system_physical]]
==== Selection of unit system physical constant

The program applies a set of consistent units. The user is free to
select any combination of unit names for:

* time latexmath:[$[\mathrm T\]$]
* length latexmath:[$[\mathrm L\]$]
* mass latexmath:[$[\mathrm M\]$]
* force latexmath:[$[\mathrm F\]$]

[[inpmod_data_group_a_data_group_identifier_one_input_line]]
===== Data group identifier, one input line

Mandatory. ~~~ UNIT NAME SPECification ~~~

[[inpmod_data_group_a_unit_names_and_gravitational]]
===== Unit names and gravitational constant

Mandatory. ~~~ UT UL UM UF GRAV GCONS ~~~

* `UT: character(6), default: "s"`: Unit name for time
* `UL: character(6), default: "m"`: Unit name for length
* `UM: character(6), default: "kg"`: Unit name for mass
* `UF: character(6), default: "kN"`: Unit name for force
* `GRAV: real > 0, default: 9.81`: Numerical value of gravitational
constant latexmath:[$[\mathrm{L/T^2}\]$]
* `GCONS: real > 0, default: 0.001`: Consistency acceleration parameter.
** `GCONS` = ACC[UF/UM]/ACC - where ACC is the numerical value of
acceleration with the force and mass units, and with the length and time
units, respectively. - With a consistent set of units, `GCONS = 1.0`.

Example: For the default units, the acceleration of gravity is
latexmath:[$9.81\times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{kN/kg}$] or
latexmath:[$9.81\,\mathrm{m/s}^2$] and `GCONS` may be calculated as
latexmath:[$\mathrm{9.81\times 10^{-3}/9.81=0.001}$].

In the case of `GCONS` latexmath:[$\mathrm{\neq 1}$], the calculation of
drag force coefficients must be multiplied by `GCONS`, for example
`CDY = GCONS` latexmath:[$\mathrm{(\frac{1}{2}\rho C_DD)}$], see also
link:#inpmod_af_fish_hydrodynamic[Hydrodynamic force coefficients] (@ref
inpmod_c_crs1_hydrodynamic).

The unit names are printed as an output heading as shown below.

(i.e. `XA` is dummy). `XA` is also dummy when no anchor point is
specified.

to 1 and the supernode type is fixed (`ITYPSN=TSNFIX`). The supernode at
upper end is automatically set to NSNOD and the supernode type is
specified position (`ITYPSN=TSNPOS`) indicating the upper end is

`STFBOT` is used for computing the spring stiffness normal to the
seafloor, latexmath:[$\mathrm{k_V}$] , for seafloor contact.
latexmath:[$\mathrm{k_V}$] = `STFBOT` latexmath:[$\mathrm{\times L}$]
where latexmath:[$\mathrm{L}$] is the element length.

Horizontal contact with the seafloor is modelled independently in the
axial and lateral directions. Contact is initially modelled with linear
springs. Sliding will occur when an axial or lateral spring force
reaches the friction force value. Springs will be reinstated if the line
starts sliding in the opposite direction, or if the friction force
increases and is greater than the spring force. The spring stiffness is
calculated as latexmath:[$\mathrm{k_s}$] = `STFxxx`
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\times L_h}$], where latexmath:[$\mathrm{L_h}$] is
the length of the element’s horizontal projection. The seafloor friction
forces are calculated as F = `FRIxxx`
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\times F_{vert}}$] and are directed against the
axial or lateral displacements.

** `IBTANG = 0`: No seafloor contact
** `IBTANG = 1`: Seafloor contact forces on all nodes that are below
`Z < ZBOT + R_EXTCNT`. The modified 3D seafloor formulation is used.

====== Seafloor stiffness, friction and damping

The following input line must only be given if `IBTANG=1`, `IBTANG=-1`
or `IBTANG=-9` ~~~ STFBOT STFAXI STFLAT FRIAXI FRILAT DAMBOT DAMAXI

the seafloor latexmath:[$[\mathrm{F\times T/L^2}\]$] - Dummy for
IBTANG=-9 - `DAMAXI: real >= 0, default: 0`: In-plane seafloor damping
coefficient in axial direction latexmath:[$[\mathrm{F\times T/L^2}\]$] -
Dummy for IBTANG=-9 - `DAMLAT: real >= 0, default: 0`: In-plane seafloor

Lateral loads are applied at the node - `= 1`: Lateral loads are applied

`STFBOT` is used for computing the vertical spring stiffness,
latexmath:[$\mathrm{k_V}$] , for seafloor contact.
latexmath:[$\mathrm{k_V}$] = `STFBOT` latexmath:[$\mathrm{\times L}$]
where latexmath:[$\mathrm{L}$] is the element length.

Horizontal contact with the seafloor is modelled independently in the
axial and lateral directions. Contact is initially modelled with linear
springs. Sliding will occur when an axial or lateral spring force
reaches the friction force value. Springs will be reinstated if the line
starts sliding in the opposite direction, or if the friction force
increases and is greater than the spring force. The spring stiffness is
calculated as latexmath:[$k_h=\mathrm{Stalks}\times L_h$], where
latexmath:[$\mathrm{L_h}$] is the length of the element’s horizontal
projection. The seafloor friction forces are calculated as
latexmath:[$F=\mathrm{FRIxxx}\times F_{vert}$] and are directed against
the axial or lateral displacements, where
latexmath:[$\mathrm{F_{vert}}$] is the vertical contact force between
the pipe and the bottom.

Giving a low `ZCUT` increases efficiency, but should not be given lower
than the highest position of any point actually in contact with the
seafloor.

[[inpmod_b_arbitrary_line]]
===== Line, line type and supernode connectivity

This data group defines the connectivity between lines and supernodes.
If the line identifier is missing the line number implicitly defined by
the order in which the lines are specified, will be used as the line
identifier. References to line type IDs and supernode IDs are mandatory.

`NLIN` input lines.

....
LINE-ID LINTYP-ID SNOD-ID1 SNOD_ID2
....

* `LINE-ID: character(8)`: Line identifier
* `LINTYP-ID: character(8)`: Reference to line type identifier
* `SNOD-ID1: character(8)`: Reference to supernode identifier at end 1
* `SNOD-ID2: character(8)`: Reference to supernode identifier at end 2

If only 3 alphanumeric strings are specified, the first string is taken
as `LINTYP-ID`, the second as `SNOD-ID1` and the third as `SNOD-ID2`:
~~~ LINTYP-ID SNOD-ID1 SNOD-ID2 ~~~ The `LINE-ID` is taken as the line
number as implicitly defined by the order in which the lines are given.

The local element y- and z-axes are found from local x-axis and a
reference vector.

The local element x-axis goes from end 1 to end 2 of the element.

The reference vector may be specified using the option
link:@ref%20inpmod_af_local[LOCAL ELEMENT AXIS].

If the line is a blade in a wind turbine and `LOCAL ELEMENT AXIS` is not
specified, the reference vector will be found as the cross product
between the local X-axis of the shaft and the local X-axis of the blade
element.

If the reference is not given by either of these two methods, the
default method will be used. If the local x-axis is not parallel with
the global z-axis, the reference vector is found as the cross product
between the local x-axis and the global z-axis. If the local x-axis is
parallel with the global z-axis, the global y-axis will be used as the
reference vector if the local x-axis is completely vertical or tilted
slightly in the positive global x-direction. Otherwise the reference
vector will point in the negative global y-direction.

The local z-axis is found as the cross product between the local x-axis
and the reference vector.

The local y-axis is then found as the cross product between the local
z-axis and the local x-axis.

For beam elements, the element axes are found at the stress-free
configuration and will subsequently follow the element.

[[inpmod_b_arbitrary_specification]]
===== Specification of boundary conditions, stressfree configuration and static equilibrium configuration

Coordinates of all supernodes must be specified to define the initial
stressfree configuration as well as the final static configuration. If
the distance between supernodes in stressfree configuration do not
correspond to the line length as specified in
link:@ref%20inpmod_b_elastic_type[Type and location of contact point,
NCNODE input lines], the length of the last segment in the line is
adjusted, and a warning is written.

[[inpmod_b_arbitrary_boundary_conditions]]
====== Boundary conditions and coordinates for supernodes with at least one fixed or prescribed degree of freedom

The following two or three input lines must be given in blocks for each
of the `NSNFIX` supernodes.

Boundary conditions: ~~~ SNOD_ID IPOS IX IY IZ IRX IRY IRZ CHCOO CHUPRO
~~~

* `SNOD_ID: character(8)`: Supernode identifier
* `IPOS: integer, default: 0`: Boundary condition type
** `IPOS = 0`: The supernode is not connected to a support vessel
** `IPOS = IVES`: The supernode is connected to support vessel number
`IVES`, `1 <= IVES <= NVES`.
* `IX: integer, default: 1`: Boundary condition code for translation in
X-direction
** `IX = 0`: Free
** `IX = 1`: Fixed or prescribed
* `IY: integer, default: 1`: Boundary condition code for translation in
Y-direction (same interpretation as for `IX`)
* `IZ: integer, default: 1`: Boundary condition code for translation in
Z-direction (same interpretation as for `IX`)
* `IRX: integer, default: 1`: Boundary condition code for rotation about
X-axis (same interpretation as for `IX`)
* `IRY: integer, default: 1`: Boundary condition code for rotation about
Y-axis (same interpretation as for `IX`)
* `IRZ: integer, default: 1`: Boundary condition code for rotation about
Z-axis (same interpretation as for `IX`)
* `CHCOO: character(6)`: Identifier for boundary condition reference
coordinate system
** `CHCOO = GLOBAL`: Boundary conditions are referenced to global
coordinate system.
** `CHCOO = SKEW-G`: Boundary conditions are referenced to a skew
coordinate system.
** `CHCOO = VESSEL`: Boundary conditions are referenced to vessel
coordinate system.
** `CHCOO = SKEW-V`: Boundary conditions are referenced to a skew vessel
coordinate system.
* `CHUPRO: character(3), default: NO`: Computational parameter.
Boundaries rotate with specified rotation
** `CHUPRO = YES`
** `CHUPRO = NO`

A supernode with prescribed motions during dynamic analysis must have
`IPOS>0`.

Possible hinges at riser ends connected to fixed supports or to a
support vessel may be modelled by either choosing the correct boundary
condition code (see above) or using ball-joint connectors. Be careful
not to use both these modelling options at the same time for a given
super-node. This will lead to program abortion.

Note that if some of the translations are not prescribed,
rotation-induced translations may cause drift-off if used in combination
with global boundary conditions at a node attached to a vessel.

Coordinates for stress free and static equilibrium position: ~~~ X0 Y0
Z0 X1 Y1 Z1 ROT DIR ~~~

* `X0: real`: Coordinates for stress free configuration specified so
that the line between any two supernodes are straight and with zero
tension. latexmath:[$[\mathrm{L}\]$]

* `X1: real, default: X0`:
* `Y1: real, default: Y0`: Coordinates for static equilibrium position
latexmath:[$[\mathrm{L}\]$]
* `Z1: real, default: Z0`
* `ROT: real, default: 0`: Specified rotation of supernode from stress
free position to static equilibrium position
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[deg\]}$]
* `DIR: real, default: 0`: Direction of axis for specified rotation
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[deg\]}$]

`ROT` is the specified rotation in degrees from stress free position to
equilibrium position and is analogous to `ALFL`/`ALFU` parameters used
for the standard systems. The rotation `ROT` will be around the local
`YREF`-axis as shown in the figure below. `DIR` is the rotation in
degrees from global X-axis to `XREF`-axis. The local `ZREF`-axis is
parallel to global Z-axis. `DIR=0` signifies that the rotation `ROT`
will be around the global Y-axis. If the line end is allowed to rotate
freely around the local `YREF`-axis, `ROT` will be dummy. Free rotation
around global Y-axis is obtained with `IRY = 0` and `DIR = 0`.

The skew Z-axis is found by the cross product between the skew X-axis
and the reference vector. The skew Y-axis is found by the cross product
between the skew Z-axis and the skew X-axis

[[inpmod_b_elastic_elastic]]
==== Elastic contact surface

This data group is optional and is available as additional information
for Arbitrary Systems only. It enables the user to model contact effects
between lines. For normal riser systems this data group should not be
considered.

The main intention of this data group is to enable modelling of
pipelines during laying operations. This includes contact forces between
the pipe and rollers on the lay barge/stinger and applied tension from a
tensioner.

Contact between roller and pipe is modelled by a bi-linear or non-linear
spring and a bi-linear dash pot damper. The contact force acts normal to
the pipe and the roller. It is treated as a discrete element load acting
on the pipe, while the contact load acting on the roller is transferred
as a nodal force to the stinger. The last includes possible torsional
moment.

The term _contact surface_ is introduced to cover stinger modelling. The
stinger may be fixed or hinged to the vessel. Generally it is curved and
may consist of a rigid part following the vessel motions and a flexible
part.

The term _contact point_ is defined as the location of rollers or
tensioner on the stinger.

Elastic contact surface

===== Contact surface modelling

A complete model of an elastic contact surface includes the following
information:

* Number of lines describing the surface The surface may consist of
several adjacent lines. By introducing several adjacent lines it is
possible to model a contact surface which has a curved stress-free
initial configuration. In addition boundary conditions for the
super-nodes at the line intersections can be specified. This is
necessary to model prescribed displacements due to vessel motions.
* Type and location of contact points Contact points can be of roller
and/or tensioner type and have to be located at ends of line segments.
* Identification of lines which may experience contact with the contact
surface. The line identification is used to limit the number of elements
that have to be checked for contact during program execution.

Supplementary information is specified in the following data groups: -

[[inpmod_b_pipe_pipe-in-pipe_contact]]
==== Pipe-in-pipe contact

This data group is optional and is available for Arbitrary Systems only.

It enables the user to model pipe-in-pipe contact effects where each of
the pipes is defined as a single line or as a main riser line. For
normal riser systems this data group is normally not necessary.

A pipe-in-pipe pair consists of a master pipe and a slave pipe. Both the
master and the slave pipe may consist of beam or bar types of elements
and must be of cross section types CRS0, CRS1 or CRS3. The contact
between the master pipe and the slave pipe will be applied between a
node on the master pipe and an element in the slave pipe. This results
in nodal loads along the master pipe and discrete element loads along
the slave pipe. The discretization of the master pipe must therefore be
fine enough to model the contact.

In the following the input parameters are described. A maximum of 400
pipe-in-pipe specifications may be given. The input lines in this group
must be given in one block for each pipe-in-pipe pair.

latexmath:[$\mathrm{EL}$] is length of shortest element attached to the

Note that Final position for winch is dummy for coupled analysis.

The RIFLEX winch formulation is intended for vertical winching and may
be unstable when deviating from vertical in dynamic analysis.

It is recommended to apply some numerical damping when using the winch
functionality, for example `BETIN = 3.9`and `GAMMA = 0.505`, see @ref
dynmod_e_method.

The Winch rotations follow the same conventions as prescribed rotations
of nodes, see @ref inpmod_b_arbitrary_boundary_conditions. The
coordinate system is rotated first using `DIRW`, followed by `ROTW`. For
example: if Rotation direction `DIRW` is set to `0.0`, the winch will
rotate `ROTW` degrees around the local y-axis. It is important to note
that the coordinate system is rotated first relative to the global
system using `DIRW`, the winch is then rotated `ROTW` degrees around the
y-axis in the updated coordinate system.

[[inpmod_b_wind_wind_turbine_specification]]
==== Wind turbine specification

This data group is optional and is only available for Arbitrary Systems.
It enables the user to model wind turbines considering wind load acting
on the blades and control system for blade pitch and electrical power
extraction. For normal riser systems this data group should not be
considered.

The wind turbine is modelled by a group of lines that constitute the
blades and the shaft, see figure `Outline of a wind turbine model'
below. In addition, references to the air foil library file and to
control data for electrical torque and blade pitch must be given.

A shared supernode at the hub connects the blades and the shaft. Each
blade must consist of two lines. The inner line represents eccentricity
and the outer line the actual foil blade. A rigid supernode connection
is used to represent connection between the two lines. The constant
term, c0, in the linear constraint equation is subsequently used for
blade pitch control.

The wind turbine blades have to be identical with regard to the element
distribution, foil profile description and aerodynamic coefficients
along the blades. The mass and stiffness distribution may be different.

The wind loads on the blades are computed based on the load coefficient
description in the air foil library file and together with a blade
element momentum (BEM) method. The applied BEM code includes dynamic
inflow, i.e. a time delay on changes of induced velocity related to the
time it takes to convect vorticity in the wake downstream, away from the
rotor. With dynamic inflow, the BEM method will give correct time series
of rotor and blade loads under conditions of changing blade pitch angle,
wind speed and direction, and tower motion. The main features of the BEM
theory are:

* Induced velocity is calculated assuming momentum balance for a
ring-shaped control volume.
* Blade sections are treated as independent.
* Aerodynamic coefficients from wind tunnel tests are used for the
blades.
* Empirical corrections are used for tip-vortices and cascade effects /
lift amplification.

The BEM theory is a proven, simple and CPU efficient method to simulate
rotor aerodynamics and the method represents the industry standard.
Additional information regarding the coordinate systems for the wind
turbine results can be found in link:@ref%20wind_turbine_results[Wind
Turbine Results].

If the stress free length of the line (sum of the segment `SLGTH`) is
not equal to the distance between the stress free coordinates of the
supernodes that the line is attached to, the stress free line length
will be modified according to the following rules:

Length modification will always be done on the last segment within the
line. Therefore the first task is to check if it is possible to modify
this segment to obtain a line length equal the to the distance. If this
is not possible the program will terminate with error message. Then the
difference between the length and the distance is within the preset
length tolerance: - Difference larger than 1% gives error termination. -
Difference between 0.1% and 1% gives modification and written warning. -
Difference less than 0.1% gives modification but no warning.

Specifying `SLGTH0` latexmath:[$\mathrm{\neq }$] `SLGTH` enables the
user to use initially stressed segments at the start of the static
analysis. This feature is useful for modelling elastic springs between
element nodes. `SLGTH` will be interpreted as stressed segment length by
the program.

[[inpmod_b_line_relative]]

The following NSEG input lines is to be given if `IADDTWI = 1`.

latexmath:[$\mathrm{[deg\]}$]
* `TWEND2: real, default: TWEND1`: Relative twist segment end 2
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[deg\]}$]

The relative twist for elements within the segment is calculated by use
of linear interpolation. The twist angle is constant over the element
length. The twist angle of the actual line will relate to the line local
Y-axis.

The local Y-axis may be set using the data group
link:@ref%20inpmod_af_local[LOCAL ELEMENT AXIS], be determined by shaft
and blade orientation for a wind turbine blade or the default procedure
may be used. See link:@ref%20inpmod_b_arbitrary_line[Line, line type and

latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L\]}$]
* `DZ: real, default: 0`: Offset in line local Z-axis segment end 2
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L\]}$]

This feature enables the user to model a curved stress-free
configuration of a line type by specifying transverse offsets at end 2
of all line segments, i.e. transverse offsets from the straight line
between the line ends. The offsets `DY` and `DZ` refer to the initial
local line Y and Z axes, disregarding any specified relative twist.

*Note!* If only NSEG-1 input lines are given, the offsets are set to
zero for the second end of the last segment.

Specified twist will be applied around the updated local element X-axis
after the offsets have been accounted for.

The stressfree segment lengths `SLGTH` will be modified according to the
specified offsets. If a segment consist of more than one element, the
intermediate nodes will be placed along the straight line between the
segment nodes.

The cross-section properties will not be changed, e.g. the specified
mass per unit length will be used together with the modified segment
length.

*Note!* If non-zero offset is specified at the second end of the last
segment, no other line may be connected to this supernode

The local Y-axis may be set using the data group
link:@ref%20inpmod_af_local[LOCAL ELEMENT AXIS], be determined by shaft
and blade orientation for a wind turbine blade or the default procedure
may be used. See link:@ref%20inpmod_b_arbitrary_line[Line, line type and

latexmath:[$[\mathrm{M/L^3}\]$]

The input lines must be given for decreasing values of `GRLEV`;
i.e. with increasing depth. Linear interpolation will be used to find
values at intermediate levels. Outside the specified range, the growth
thickness is set to zero, i.e. for `Z > GRLEV(1)` and
`Z < GRLEV(NGRLEV)` the thickness is zero.

Marine growth will be applied to elements with `CRS0`, `CRS1`, `CRS2`,
`CRS3`, `CRS4` and `CRS7` cross-sections.

The volume loads will be modified if the external area is non-zero. A
circular cross-section is assumed and the thickness of the marine growth
is added to the radius corresponding to the initial external area.

The Morison quadratic drag and added mass coefficients will be modified
if the hydrodynamic diameter is non-zero. For `CRS2`, `CRS4` and `CRS7`
cross-sections, the diameter of a circular cross-sections with the same
external area is used as the hydrodynamic diameter. The quadratic drag
coefficients will be scaled by the ratio of the updated to the initial
hydrodynamic diameter. The added mass coefficients will be scaled by the
square of this ratio. Linear drag coefficients will not be modified.

Marine growth will be applied if it is specified as a load group in
`STAMOD`. The load incrementation procedure is specified as input to the
`STAMOD` module.

Currently, only one growth profile may be given.

Note that specification of marine growth profile cannot be used in
combination with drag amplification (@ref stamod_sawu).

A complete environmental description consists of environmental
constants, wave and current data. When an environment description has
been completed, a new one may be given by repeating data groups
`Identification of the environment' to `Current parameters' with the
appropriate data for the new environment. Up to 10 complete
environmental descriptions may be given as input to `INPMOD` in one run
each identified by an unique identifier given in data group
`Identification of the environment'. The minimum data required in one
environmental condition is environmental constants (i.e. data groups
`Water depth and wave indicator' and `Environment constants' are
required).

An environment description can contain up to 10 irregular wave cases and
10 regular wave cases. A uniquely defined environment used in `STAMOD`
or `DYNMOD` must refer to the actual environment by the identifier
`IDENV` and wave case number.

If a numerically defined spectrum is used, `IWASP1=5` in

should be avoided as the average wave propagation direction will not be
included in this case. The same applies to `IWADR2`.

format)
** `IWITYP=13`: Fluctuating 3-comp. wind read from files (TurbSim Bladed

** `IWITYP=14`: Stationary uniform wind with shear

The wind types 10 - 14 are intended for wind turbine analyses. However,
they may also be applied for other type of analysis.

For the IECWind fluctuating 3-component wind (`IWITYP=12`), only the
fluctuating part of the wind is given in the wind input files. The mean
wind speed `UMEAN` given above is added to the yield the total wind
velocity in the longitudinal direction. The input files must conform to
the 3-dimensional 3-component wind time series from the rectangular IEC
format (See Thomsen, K., 2006. Mann turbulence for the IEC Code
Comparison Collaborative (OC3). Risø National Laboratory). More
specifically they must include time series of wind velocity in binary
format, with a 3-dimensional array having indices in vertical direction
running fastest, then indices in lateral direction and indices in
longitudinal direction running slowest.

For wind files from NREL’s TurbSim (`IWITYP=13`), the mean wind speed
and shear are included in the binary files. The input files must be
generated by TurbSim with WrBLFF=True. Both the .wnd file and .sum file
are needed.

====== Fluctuating 3-component wind field read from TurbSim file (IWITYP=13)

The wind field domain- and field size are extracted from the TurbSim
.sum file.

The wind field domain location in the global coordinate system is not
given explicitly by the user. The vertical position of the wind field
center is the same as in TurbSim; i.e. taken as the hub height given on
the turbsim .sum file.

Horizontally, the wind field is positioned around the global origin, but
with a half grid width downwind of the origin. Since the TurbSim wind is
non-periodic, this is necessary to ensure that the entire turbine lies
in the same part of the wind field at the start of the simulation. The
wind at the global origin will thus not start at the first slice

The wind field must be large enough to ensure that the whole structure
is within the wind field during the entire simulation. As the TurbSim
wind field is nonperiodic, the beginning and end of the wind field will
not fit together.

Observe that the motion transfer function definition is related to the
wave field definition. See `Motion Transfer Functions' in the Theory
Manual for the definition of wave field and motion transfer functions.
Transfer functions based on other definitions must be converted by
appropriate phase shift operations before they are used as input to this
program.

This data group needs not be given for systems with no vessel attachment
points. Note that either `Support vessel data on file' or
`Identification' through `Transfer function input' is to be given.

The complex form and the amplitude ratio are to be given as
non-dimensional. This means: - L/L for freedoms surge, sway and heave -
radian/radians or degrees/degrees for freedoms roll, pitch and yaw,
giving motion angle/surface wave slope amplitude. The wave slope
amplitude is defined by latexmath:[$\mathrm{\gamma _a=k\zeta_a}$] where
latexmath:[$\mathrm{k}$] is the wave number and
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\zeta_a}$] is the wave amplitude.

If `NDHFTR=1`, `ISYMHF` is dummy (set to zero by the program). In this
case the specified transfer function is used, regardless of the wave
direction. Note that the specified motions are applied in the local
vessel coordinate system regardless of the wave direction; e.g.  surge
motions are applied in the local vessel x-direction. In practice, the
wave direction will not have any effect on the vessel motions in this
case. To rotate the motions with the wave direction, update the vessel
heading when the wave direction is changed. This method must however be
used with care, if the model is not symmetric and connected to the
vessel in the local vessel origo, it may not give the desired effect.

link:@ref%20inpmod_e_transfer_input_data[Data group identifier, one
input line] is repeated for each degree of freedom included in motion
description. If one (or more) degrees of freedom are omitted, they are
set equal to zero.

For phase and sign convention, see `Motion Transfer Functions' in the
Theory Manual.

If only one direction is specified (`NDHFTR=1`), the transfer function
is used independent of incoming wave direction.

Amplitudes and phase angles at required frequencies are calculated by
linear interpolation/extrapolation in the dynamic analysis. Transfer
functions will therefore be extrapolated for spectral components outside
the frequency range defined for the transfer function. Ensure that the
amplitude values given for the two highest/lowest frequencies give
physical realistic values when extrapolated. Add two zero amplitude
components at both ends of the frequency range if no extrapolation is
wanted.

Linear interpolation is also used for wave direction.

[[inpmod_aif_specification]]
==== Specification of internal control system for blade pitch and electrical power

[[inpmod_aif_specification_description]]
===== Description of internal control system

The implemented control system is based on the choice of a conventional
variable-speed, variable blade-pitch-to-feather configuration wind
turbine and consists of two basic control systems: a generator torque
controller and a full span rotor-collective blade-pitch controller. The
two control systems are designed to work independently. The objective of
generator-torque controller is to maximize power capture below the rated
operation point. The goal of the blade-pitch controller is to regulate
generator speed above the rated operation point.

====== Control measurement filter

Both the generator torque and blade pitch controllers use the generator
speed as the sole feedback input. A recursive, single-pole low-pass
filter exponential smoothing to reduce the high frequency excitation of
the control systems is provided. The discrete time recursion equation
for this filter is

latexmath:[$\mathrm{\omega _{f.k}=\alpha \omega _{f.k-1}+(1-\alpha )\omega _K}$]

where

latexmath:[$\mathrm{\alpha =exp((-\Delta t)/(TC))}$]

where latexmath:[$\mathrm{\Delta t}$] is the discrete time step,
latexmath:[$\mathrm{TC}$] is the filter time constant,
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\alpha }$] is the low-pass filter coefficient
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\omega _f}$] is low pass filtered generator speed
and latexmath:[$\mathrm{k}$] indicates the time step. The relation
between the filter time constant and the cut off (corner) frequency
latexmath:[$\mathrm{f_C}$] is given by:

latexmath:[$\mathrm{TC=\frac{1}{2\pi f_C}}$]

====== Generator torque controller

The generator torque is computed as a tabulated function of the filtered
generator speed, incorporating five control regions: 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2
and 3 as illustrated in the figure `Illustration of the variable speed
controller - Generator torque versus generator speed' below. Region 1 is
a control region before cut-in wind speed, where the generator torque is
zero and no power is extracted. Instead, the wind is used to accelerate
the rotor for start-up. Region 2 is a control region for optimizing
power capture. Here, the generator torque is proportional to the quare
of the filtered generator speed to maintain a constant (optimal)
tip-speed ratio. In region 3, the generator torque or the generator
power is held constant. In case of constant power the generator torque
is inversely proportional to the filtered generator speed.

====== Blade pitch controller

In region 3, the collective blade pitch angle commands are computed
using a gain-scheduled proportional-integral (PI) control on the speed
error between the filtered generator speed and the rated generator
speed. The PI regulator is represented by the Laplace transform:
latexmath:[$\mathrm{(K(s+a))/s}$] where latexmath:[$\mathrm{K}$] and
latexmath:[$\mathrm{a}$] are the proportional gain and the integrator
gain. The corresponding and simple regulator algorithm is given by

latexmath:[$\mathrm{R(t+\Delta t)=R(t)+\Delta \omega \Delta t}$]

latexmath:[$\mathrm{\theta=K_P\Delta \omega +aK_PR(t+\Delta t)=K_P\Delta \omega +K_IR(t+\Delta t)}$]

where latexmath:[$\mathrm{\Delta t}$] is the regulator time step,
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\Delta \omega }$] is the rotor speed error, i.e. the
difference between filtered rotor speed and rated rotor speed.
latexmath:[$\mathrm{R}$] is accumulated time integrated speed error
which is set to zero for filtered generator speed less than rated
generator speed. latexmath:[$\mathrm{\theta}$] is the
instructed/required collective blade pitch angle.

====== Gain scheduling

Gain scheduling is introduced because the optimal proportional and
integrator gains are dependent of the blade pitch angle. At each step
the gain will be corrected based on the pitch angle applied in the
previous step. The user may specify a gain scheduling law or choose to
apply the default law presented in the table `The defaults gain
scheduling law'. For intervening generator speeds, linear interpolation
is used.

generator speed

[[inpmod_aif_extWTcontrol_description]]
===== Description of control system interface

The external control class must contain at least the three main methods
(init, step, and finish) that are called by RIFLEX.

====== init

`init` is called once at the beginning of RIFLEX DYNMOD. The controller
receives input from RIFLEX about the time step, number of blades, and
the name of the control input file.

....
public void init(double dt, int nblades, String filename)
....

====== step

`step` is called at the beginning of each time step in RIFLEX DYNMOD.
The controller receives measurements (rotor velocity, pitch angles, hub
position/velocity/acceleration, instantaneous wind velocity at the hub,
etc.) from RIFLEX and returns feedback (torque to be applied on the
rotor, pitch angle to be applied on each blade, and - for output
purposes - gear shaft rotor speed and generated electrical power).

....
public void step(Measurements measurements, Feedback feedback) 
....

`measurements` contains:

* omega: Rotor velocity latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad/T\]}$]. May be
extracted with the Java method getOmega().
* pitch angles: Blade pitch angles for all blades
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad\]}$]. May be extracted with the Java method
getPitchAngle(i), i = 0, …, nblades-1.
* position: (x,y,z,rx,ry,rz) dynamic displacement
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L\]}$] and rotation latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad\]}$]
from final static position / orientation for the node at the second end
of the shaft flex-joint. Values are in the shaft measurement system
described below. May be extracted with the Java method getPosition().
* velocity: (vx,vy,vz,vrx,vry,vrz) velocity
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L/T\]}$] and angular velocity
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad/T\]}$] for the node at the second end of the
shaft flex-joint. Values are in the shaft measurement system described
below. May be extracted with the Java method getVelocity().
* acceleration: (ax,ay,az,arx,ary,arz) acceleration
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L/T^2\]}$] and angular acceleration
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad/T^2\]}$] for the node at the second end of the
shaft flex-joint. Values are in the shaft measurement system described
below. May be extracted with the Java method getAcceleration().
* hub wind: (wix,wiy,wiz) hub wind velocity
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L/T\]}$], global coordinate system. May be
extracted with the Java method getHubWindVelocity().
* blade root torsional moment around local element x-axis for all blades
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[FL\]}$]. May be extracted with the Java method
getBladeRootBMX(i), i = 0, …, nblades-1.
* blade root bending moment around local element y-axis for all blades
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[FL\]}$]. May be extracted with the Java method
getBladeRootBMY(i), i = 0, …, nblades-1.
* blade root bending moment around local element z-axis for all blades
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[FL\]}$]. May be extracted with the Java method
getBladeRootBMZ(i), i = 0, …, nblades-1.
* aerodynamic torsional moment load around local element x-axis for all
blades latexmath:[$\mathrm{[FL\]}$]. May be extracted with the Java
method getBladeRootAeroTor(i), i = 0, …, nblades-1.
* nodal measurements for the `NNOD_MEAS` specified nodes. 18 values for
each node: 3 displacements latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L\]}$] and 3 rotations
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad\]}$] relative to the stress-free configuration,
6 velocities latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L/T\]}$] or
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad/T\]}$] and 6 accelerations
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[L/T^2\]}$] or latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad/T^2\]}$].
The rotations (R1,R2,R3) are taken in the order R3, R2, R1 ; i.e. first
rotation around the global z-axis, then around the local (rotated)
y-axis and then finally around the local (rotated) x-axis. Global or
shaft measurement system as selected by input. May be extracted with the
Java method getAddNodeMeas(i) i, i = 0, …, nnod_meas-1. nnod_meas may be
extracted with the Java method getNnodMeas().
* element measurements for the `NEL_MEAS` specified elements. 10 values
for each element: effective tension latexmath:[$\mathrm{[F\]}$],
torsional moment latexmath:[$\mathrm{[FL\]}$], My-moment end 1 and 2
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[FL\]}$], Mz-moment end 1 and 2
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[FL\]}$], Qy-shear force end 1 and 2
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[F\]}$], Qz-shear force end 1 and 2
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[F\]}$]. Local element system. May be extracted with
the Java method getAddNelMeas(i), i = 0, …, nel_meas-1. nel_meas may be
extracted with the Java method getNelMeas().

The shaft measurement system is used for the hub position, velocity and
acceleration measurements and may be chosen for the additional nodal
measurements. This coordinate system is determined from the stress-free
orientation of the shaft element where the electrical torque is applied.
- the local z-axis is vertical, - the local x-is the horizontal
projection of the element’s x axis - the local y-axis is oriented so
that the x-, y- and z-axes are a right-handed coordinate system
(i.e. the y-axis is the vector cross product of the local z- and x-aces)

If the stress-free orientation of the shaft is in the global X-Z plane,
the shaft measurement coordinate system will coincide with the global
coordinate system.

`feedback` contains:

* Torque request: Actuator torque to apply on rotor axis
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[ML^2/T^2\]}$]
* Pitch angle request for all blades: Controller pitch angle
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad\]}$]
* Gear shaft omega: Gear shaft rotor speed
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[rad/T\]}$] Used for presentation only.
* Generated power: Generated electrical power
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[kW\]}$] Used for presentation only.

are not referred to will be ignored.

Comment lines may be included on any line, as in other input files.
Blank lines between airfoils will at present be ignored, but it is
recommended to use comment lines instead. Blank lines at other locations
in the file will be interpreted as input lines and the default values
will be used.

given below
** `= 0`: No user-defined dynamic stall initialization parameters will
be given

[[inpmod_aif_airlib_airdat]]
===== Airfoil data

One block per Reynolds number, i.e. NRE data blocks

If only one block is given, the data will be used for all Reynolds
numbers. For Reynolds numbers outside the range of Reynolds numbers
given, the data for the closest Reynolds number will be used; i.e. flat
extrapolation.

====== Reynolds number

....
RE NAOA
....

* `RE: real`: Reynolds number for this block latexmath:[$\mathrm{[1\]}$]
* `NAOA: integer`: number of angle-of-attack points for this data block

[[inpmod_aif_airlib_ds]]
====== Dynamic stall initialization parameters

To be given only if `DSIN`=1

AOA0 DCLDA1 DCLDA2 AOAFS1 AOAFS2
....

* `AOA0: real`: the angle of attack where there is zero lift, upcrossing
latexmath:[$\mathrm{[deg\]}$]
* `DCLDA1: real`: maximum slope of the lift curve in the linear region
above AOA0 latexmath:[$\mathrm{[1/deg\]}$]
* `DCLDA2: real`: maximum slope of the lift curve in the linear region
below AOA0 latexmath:[$\mathrm{[1/deg\]}$]
* `AOAFS1: real`: angle of attack corresponding to full separation above
AOA0 latexmath:[$\mathrm{[deg\]}$]
* `AOAFS2: real`: angle of attack corresponding to full separation below
AOA0 latexmath:[$\mathrm{[deg\]}$]

The dynamic stall initialization parameters are shown in the figure
`Illustration of dynamic stall initialization parameters' below.

[[inpmod_aif_airlib_airgeo]]
===== Normalized airfoil geometry

NGEO input lines, to be given only if `NGEO > 0`. +
Airfoil coordinates are normalized by the chord length, with the origin
at the aerodynamic reference point. Points around the full airfoil
should be given, i.e. several lines may have the same `XGEO` and
different values for `YGEO`.

....
XGEO YGEO
....

* `XGEO: real`: x coordinate of geometry point, normalized by chord
length.
* `YGEO: real`: y coordinate of geometry point, normalized by chord
length.
