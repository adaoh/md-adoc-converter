== Input to OUTMOD

[[outmod_general_information]]
=== General Information

The post-processing module `OUTMOD` has two main purposes:

* Generate result printout from the `INPMOD`, `STAMOD` and `DYNMOD`
modules.
* Prepare a plot file (`IFNPLO`) for later use by the plot module
(`PLOMOD`). Note that this functionality is deprecated.

Locations for result presentation are identified by the line identifier
and segment and element numbers specified as input to `INPMOD` for all
single riser systems (i.e. SA, SB, SC, SD and AR systems).

The user chooses the amount of printout by giving the appropriate
options as input data to `OUTMOD`. As for the other modules, input data
to `OUTMOD` are organised in groups. Some groups consist of the data
group identifier only, whilst other groups have additional input lines.
The first part of the input data is data groups selecting data to be
printed. Then a command must be given to start the printing. Then a new
set of data groups selecting data may be given etc, see the figure
below.

Organization of OUTMOD input

[[outmod_a]]
=== Data Group A: OUTMOD Identification and Control Data

[[outmod_a_text]]
==== OUTMOD identification text

If you want an identification text to be printed on the front page of
the `OUTMOD` printout, the following data group may be given as the
first data group:

[[outmod_a_text_data]]
===== Data group identifier, one input line

....
OUTMod IDENTIFICATION TEXT CHVERS
....

* `CHVERS: character(8)`: `RIFLEX` output file version, e.g. 3.2

[[outmod_a_text_identification]]
===== Identification text, three input lines

....
Identification text, line no 1
Identification text, line no 2
Identification text, line no 3
....

If the data group is given, all three lines must be given, but they may
be blank.

[[outmod_a_print]]
==== The PRINT command

When `OUTMOD` is used for print generation, the following data group
identifier must be given subsequent to the specifications:

....
PRINT
....

After printing, all specifications will be deleted. Subsequent to the
print command, a new sequence of specifications and a new print command
may be given. This is useful if you want to repeat one or more
specifications with different parameters.

[[outmod_a_plot]]
==== Plot generation

*This functionality is deprecated!*

If you want to have plots from `STAMOD` or `DYNMOD`, you have to run
`OUTMOD` first to produce the plot file, `IFNPLO`, which is the only
file the plot module `PLOMOD` reads when plotting from the above
mentioned modules.

It is not possible to generate plots of all data groups. This is marked
by the word `Plot` or `NoPlot` in the right part of the data group
identifier frame:

....
WFMOtion TIME SERies        Plot
....

can be plotted, while the following can not:

....
INFIrr CONTRol INFOrmation      NoPlot
....

When you want to use `OUTMOD` to build up file `IFNPLO`, the data group
identifiers and print options are exactly the same as when you use
`OUTMOD` for normal printout, except for the following:

* `IFNPLO` must be initialized by one of the data group identifiers
described in `Initialization of the plot file IFNPLO' (below).
* Instead of the `PRINT` command, the `PLOT` command must be given (see
link:@ref%20outmod_a_plot_command[The PLOT command]). The `OUTMOD` print
file will contain the same information as if the `PRINT` command was
given, i.e. the `PLOT` command may be considered as an extension to the
`PRINT` command.

Normally, one specification gives one plot which may consist of up to
three graphs. In some cases, e.g. when one specification gives results
for six degrees of freedoms, two plots are produced per specification.

[[outmod_a_plot_initialization]]
===== Initialization of the plot file IFNPLO

When `OUTMOD` is to be used for plot generation, one of the following
initialization commands must be given after specification of `OUTMOD`
identification text (if given), but before any specification described
in Sections link:@ref%20outmod_b[Data Group B: Output from STAMOD], or
link:@ref%20outmod_c[Data Group C: Output from DYNMOD]:

....
NEW PLOT FILE
....

or

....
APPEnd PLOT FILE
....

If the command `NEW PLOT FILE` is given, `OUTMOD` writes the plot arrays
from the beginning of the file, i.e. the previous contents of the file,
if any, are overwritten. It is, however, possible to append new plots
after already existing plots on file `IFNPLO`. This is achieved by
giving the command `APPEND PLOT FILE`. A check is carried out to ensure
that the file already contains plots.

A maximum of 100 plots may be stored in one `IFNPLO` file.

If more than one initialization command is given throughout an `OUTMOD`
run, they are simply ignored.

[[outmod_a_plot_command]]
===== The PLOT command

When `OUTMOD` is used for plot generation, the following command is
given instead of the `PRINT` command (see link:@ref%20outmod_a_print[The
PRINT command]):

....
PLOT
....

If a plot command is given for a data group that cannot be plotted, a
warning message is issued on `OUTMOD` print file and execution continues
with the next data group specified.

There may be more than one `PLOT` within one run of `OUTMOD`, following
the same rules as for the `PRINT` command. `PRINT` and `PLOT` commands
may be mixed within one run.

If the `PLOT` command is given, and neither `NEW PLOT FILE` nor
`APPEND PLOT FILE` has been given, the program will terminate with an
error message.

[[outmod_a_communication]]
==== Communication with the STARTIMES programs

The following command has been included for communication with the
`STARTIMES` programs for statistical analysis of time series

....
STARtimes FILE      NoPlot
....

This command specifies that time series of a selected response quantity
shall be written to a file in `STARTIMES` format (i.e. to a file
readable by the `STARTIMES` programs). The `STARTIMES FILE` command can
be used in connection with the following data group identifiers:

* `WAVE ELEVATION`
* `WFMOTION TIME SERIES`
* `LFMOTION TIME SERIES`
* `TOMOTION TIME SERIES`
* `DYNDISP TIME SERIES`
* `TOTDISP TIME SERIES`
* `DYNFORC TIME SERIES`
* `DYNCURV TIME SERIES`
* `SUPPF TIME SERIES`
* `ELMANGLE TIME SERIES`
* `TOTFORC TIME SERIES`
* `DISTANCE TIME SERIES`
* `CALCURV TIME SERIES`
* `STRESS TIME SERIES`
* `STROKE TIME SERIES`

A response quantity is written to the `STARTIMES` file by giving
`STARTIMES FILE` immediately before the `PRINT` or `PLOT` command.

The name of the `STARTIMES` file is `<prefix>_outmod.ts`, and it is
stored in the current working directory. A description of this file is
found in link:@ref%20outmod_startimes[Description of STARTIMES file].

[[outmod_a_end]]
==== The END command

To terminate the input data, the following data group identifier is
given as the last input line on the `OUTMOD` input file.

....
END
....

The END data group is mandatory

[[outmod_b]]
=== Data Group B: Output from STAMOD

Description of result presentation from static analyses is given in the
following.

[[outmod_b_results]]
==== Results from static fixed parameter analysis

Displacement and force data from static fixed parameter analysis are

Explanation of the input parameters in input lines `SN data, 2 × NOFC
input lines' (above). All parameters are found in figure below.

Example 1: 2 segments and fatigue limit Note that FATLIM can be
alternatively specified]figures/um_io_fig325svg

Example 2: 3 segments and not fatigue limit Illustration of input data
for fatigue capacity curve definition ]figures/um_io_fig326svg

The SN curves defined by input parameters are always assumed to relate
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\Delta S}$] (stress range) to number of cycles
before failure.

A straight-lined SN curve in log-log scale is in general defined as

latexmath:[$\mathrm{N=C\times \Delta S^m}$]

or

latexmath:[$\mathrm{logN=logC+m\times log\Delta S}$]

Where: - latexmath:[$\mathrm{N}$]: Number of cycles to failure -
latexmath:[$\mathrm{\Delta S}$]: Stress range

The two input parameters used to define the SN curves are directly found
in the equation above, namely - latexmath:[$\mathrm{RC=logC\quad}$]
(always positive) - latexmath:[$\mathrm{RM=m\quad}$] (always negative)

If the user has an SN curve without having these parameters explicitly
defined, they can be calculated as follows:

]figures/um_io_fig329svg

Using the two points A and B on the figure to define the straight line,
we have

latexmath:[$\mathrm{logN=\frac{logN_2-logN_1}{log\Delta S_2-log\Delta S_1}\times log\Delta S-\frac{logN_2-logN_1}{log\Delta S_2-log\Delta S_1}\times log\Delta S_1+logN_1}$]

Hence: -
latexmath:[$\mathrm{RM=\frac{logN_2-logN_1}{log\Delta S_2-log\Delta S_1}}\quad$]
(always negative) -
latexmath:[$\mathrm{RC=-RM\times log\Delta S_1+logN_1}\quad$] (always
positive)

The relation between these parameters specified for different unit
systems is easily found from the equations above.

[[outmod_startimes]]
=== Description of STARTIMES File

==== Description of STARTIMES file generated by OUTMOD

===== General comments

A time series generated by `OUTMOD` is identified by a time series
number and a version number. Response type is identified by the time
series number, see description below. The selected node number or
element number is identified by the version number.

For one response type versions are numbered `1,2,3,4......N` according
to:

* version `1` for 1st selected element/node,
* version `2` for 2nd selected element/node,
* `...`
* version `N` for last selected element/node

Time series number and version number are printed to `OUTMOD` result
file for each selected response. In addition, `FEM` element/node number
is included in identification text for each time series stored on
`STARTIMES` file.

===== Example

Output of time series of dynamic axial force for element `1, 33, 45` is
specified in `OUTMOD`. Identifiers to generated time series are:

* Element 1: 40.01 (time series number 40, version number 1)
* Element 33: 40.02 (time series number 40, version number 2)
* Element 45: 40.03 (time series number 40, version number 3)
